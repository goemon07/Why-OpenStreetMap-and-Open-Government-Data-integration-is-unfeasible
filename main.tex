\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
OpenStreetMap is a growing reality which represents the strength of crowdsourcing of geodata. The conjunction of that platform with the Open Government Data movement, which is growing too in the last decade, could generate an impressive public database that can be used by third parties to improve the lives of citizens all around the world.
Nevertheless, this result still seems to be just a daydream. Are licensing conflicts the real main reason for the problem?
%The abstract should summarize the contents of the paper and should
%contain at least 70 and at most 150 words. It should be written using the
%\emph{abstract} environment.
